# This is a hack around nginx security defaults. The ingress-nginx controller will
# give you a 403 if you attempt to source the client CA secret from another
# namespace, as -- well -- you can then read any secret from the whole platform.
# You can disable this behaviour, but it's better to be secure, so we create a
# dummy client certificate here that we can extract the CA from.
