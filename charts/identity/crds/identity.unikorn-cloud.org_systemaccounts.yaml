          SystemAccount is a namespaced resource that defines a system account name
          (provided by clients as an X.509 client certificate CN) and a role associated
          with that client.  This aims to decouple services, and role definitions,
          from the identity service itself.

                      This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                      allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                      almost certainly wrong.
