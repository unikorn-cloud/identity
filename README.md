Identity Provider.
This package provides an OIDC compliant server, that federates other OIDC and oauth2 compliant backends.

## Architecture

![Resource](./docs/images/resources.png)

Conceptually, the identity service is quite simple, but does feature some enterprise grade features, described in the following sections.

### Organizations

The top level resource type is an organization.
Organizations are named and limited by normal Kubernetes resource name semantics (i.e. a DNS label).
Like all resources they may have a description attached to provide verbose identification.

Organizations MAY define a domain e.g. `acme.com`.
This allows users to login via email address where one of the generic IdP backends does not suffice, or the user isn't aware of who is providing identity services.
By specifying a domain, any user whose email domain matches a registered organization domain will be routed to the correct IdP configured for the organization.
This allows the use of a custom IdP that is not Google Identity (Google Workspace) or Microsoft Entra (Office 365), for example Okta or Authentik.

### oauth2 Providers

The identity service provides some generic providers which covers the vast majority of many organizations.

You can _bring your own_ by providing:

* And OIDC compliant issuer endpoint
* A client ID
* A client secret

By default Identity supports:

* Google Workspace
* Microsoft Entra
* GitHub

### Users

Users are a "global" resource that forms a unique record for a specific individual.
The intention going forward is to allow aggregation of different identifiers (e.g. email addresses) that map to a single place for identity and preference information to be stored.

The user record forms the core of security on the platform.
An end user cannot login without a corresponding user record.

The user record also contains OIDC session data.
When a user logs in, the authenticator creates or updates a session record for the user per-OIDC client.
This facilitates token validation and revocation, and single use of refresh tokens.

Users can exist in multiple states: `active`, `suspended` meaning they cannot login, or `pending` to indicate the system is awaiting email verification.

### Organization Users

Organization users are simply organization scoped user records that reference a global user.
This allows users to be members of multiple organizations.

Like users, these can exist in `active` or `suspended` states allowing an organization administrator to remove access to that organization only.

Like users a login attempt without any corresponding organization user will be denied.
The exception to this rule is a platform administrator.

### Roles

Roles grant fine grain permissions to users that permit individual operations (create, read, update, delete) to individual API endpoints.

We define a number of default roles, but the system is flexible enough to have any arbitrary roles.

The `administrator` role allows broad access across an organization, it can edit then organizations, create groups and associate users and roles with them, create projects and associate groups with them.
Administrator users can generally see all resources within the organization defined for other services, and manage them.

The `user` role cannot modify anything defined by the identity service, it's only allowed to discover organizations and projects its a member of.
Users SHOULD have additional permissions defined for external services, e.g. provisioning and management of compute infrastructure.

The `reader` is similar to the `user` but allows read only access, typically used by billing and auditing teams.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do define external 3rd party roles, you will be responsible for removing any references to them from groups on deletion.
> Failure to do so will result in dangling references, an inconsistency and an error condition.

### Groups

Every organization SHOULD have some groups, as it's useless without them.
Groups define a set of organization users that belong to them, and a set of roles associated with that group.

### Projects

Projects provide workspaces for use by external services.
Users are included in a project by associating it with a group, therefore each project SHOULD have at least one group associated with it.

Like most other components, flexibility is built in by design, so a project can be shared with multiple groups.

## Security

### OIDC Clients

Any compliant OIDC client library should be able to interact with the identity service, and passes the OpenID Connect Basic Conformance Suite.

It features service discovery for simple configuration, and the login hint extension for seamless token refresh.

To enable a client, you will need to create a `oauth2client` resource in the identity service namespace, featuring the client ID (must be unique, typically you can use `uuidgen` for this), and an OIDC callback URI.

Optionally you can override the branding with a custom login and error URL callback too.
These are available on the `OAuth2Client` data type.
See the reference implementation [login](https://github.com/unikorn-cloud/ui/tree/main/src/routes/login) and [error](https://github.com/unikorn-cloud/ui/tree/main/src/routes/error) pages for the interface.

Once created, the `oauth2client` controller will generate a client secret in the resource status that can be shared with the relaying party.

### Authentication

Authentication is handled in a few different ways:

* OIDC authorization code flow (for typical users via a browser).
* Service accounts (that issue long lived access tokens).
* System accounts secured by X.509 (used by services to talk to one another, and potentially financial grade users).

Service endpoints that users directly interact with will use token introspection against he Identity service to authenticate a user, then retrieve and ACL to authorize the request.

Services that act on behalf of an end user will use X.509 to retrieve an access token, then when interacting with downstream services will have that token authenticated and authorized in exactly the same way as with end user tokens.

### RBAC

The identity service provides centralized role based access control to the suite of services.
As described previously, roles can be arbitrary and apply to services outside of the identity service.

A role is composed of a set of arbitrary endpoint scopes, that typically define an API endpoint group e.g. `kubernetes:clusters` or `identity:projects`.
Within an endpoint scope is a set of permissions; `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete` (i.e. CRUD).

Endpoint scopes are grouped by identity scopes, `global` scopes affect all resources on the platform, `organization` scopes are limited to an organization and `project` scopes are limited to specific projects.

The API provides access to an access control list (ACL) which contains global scopes, organization scopes for the selected organization, and project scopes within that organization.

The ACL is used to:

* Control API access to endpoint resources.
* Drive UI views tailored to what actions the user can actually perform.

### Scoping

Some APIs e.g. listing Kubernetes clusters within an organization, are implicitly scoped.
These will return all clusters if you have global or organization scoped cluster read access, or only those resources that exist in projects you have cluster read access to.

## Integration with Other Services

By itself, the identity service doesn't offer much functionality beyond simple OIDC authentication flows.
Other services are responsible for provisioning and managing actual resources.

Because of historical reasons, organizations and projects create namespaces.
This allowed projects and resources within them to accept any name the end user wished to use.
Now we use random UUIDs to name resources and allow the actual human readable names to be mutable via a label.

![Resource](./docs/images/namespaces.png)

There is still some utility to having the namespaces in place as we can use it as a selector when listing resources.

The identity service manages all this for you automatically.
Unique namespace names are automatically generated by the platform, and organization and project resources record this in their status for easy navigation.

Other services, e.g. the Kubernetes service can then consume the project namespace by having their custom resources residing in there, separating them from other projects and other organizations.

## Installation

Identity is the first thing you should install, as it provides authentication services for other services, or can be used as a standalone identity provider.

### Prerequisites

* A domain name (`acme.com` for this tutorial)
* [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) configured on your Kubernetes cluster to listen to `Ingress` resources.
* [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) configured on your Kubernetes cluster
* A cert-manager `ClusterIssuer` configured for use, typically Let's Encrypt, but you can use a self signed CA.

```shell
DOMAIN=acme.com
```

### Configuring an OIDC Backend

First you will need to calculate what the OIDC callback will be.
Choose a public DNS name from your domain e.g. `identity.acme.com`.
The OIDC callback URI will be `https://identity.acme.com/oidc/callback`:

```shell
IDENTITY_HOST=identity.${DOMAIN}
IDENTITY_OIDC_CALLBACK=https://${IDENTITY_HOST}/oidc/callback
```

Most OIDC providers will be configured by creating an "Application".
This will require the callback URI to be registered as trusted.
The identity provider will give you an issuer or discovery endpoint, client ID and client secret for the following steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Only Google Identity, Microsoft Entra and GitHub are currently supported.
> Documentation for individual providers is provided by them.

### Installing the Service with Helm

You must first define where the UI will live in order to configure that OIDC callback and setup CORS:

```shell
UI_HOST=console.${DOMAIN}
UI_ORIGIN=https://${UI_HOST}
UI_OIDC_CALLBACK=${UI_ORIGIN}/oauth2/callback
UI_LOGIN_CALLBACK=${UI_ORIGIN}/login
UI_ERROR_CALLBACK=${UI_ORIGIN}/error
UI_CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen)
```

Create a basic `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
host: ${IDENTITY_HOST}
cors:
  allowOrigin:
  - ${UI_ORIGIN}
ingress:
  clusterIssuer: letsencrypt-production
  externalDns: true
clients:
  unikorn-ui:
    redirectURI: ${UI_OIDC_CALLBACK}
    homeURI: ${UI_ORIGIN}
    loginURI: ${UI_LOGIN_CALLBACK} # (optional)
    errorURL: ${UI_ERROR_CALLBACK}
providers:
  google-identity:
    description: Google Identity
    type: google # (must be either google or microsoft)
    issuer: https://accounts.google.com
    clientID: <string> # provided by the identity provider, see above
    clientSecret: <string> # provider by the identity provider, see above
platformAdministrators:
  subjects:
  - wile.e.coyote@acme.com
```

Install the Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add unikorn-identity https://unikorn-cloud.github.io/identity
```

Deploy:

```shell
helm update --install --namespace unikorn-identity unikorn-identity/unikorn-identity -f values.yaml
```

### Email Notifications and User Verification

Identity supports a mode of operation where new user accounts need to be verified before they can be made active.
First you will need to configure SMTP.
Consult your provider on acquiring the server, port, and credentials.

Create a secret containing the credentials:

```shell
kubectl create secret -n unikorn-identity generic --from-literal username=${USERNAME} --from-literal password=${PASSWORD} unikorn-smtp-credentials
```

Next configure your `values.yaml` file to add in the SMTP server information and enable user verification:

```yaml
smtp:
  host: smtp.mail.yahoo.com:465

signup:
  enabled: true
```

### Installing the Management Plugin

Download the following [artefacts](https://github.com/unikorn-cloud/kubectl-unikorn/releases) and install them in your path:

* `kubectl-unikorn`
* `kubectl_complete-unikorn`

### User Onboarding

Typically your deployment will have a small select few engineers who are able to see and do everything, including creating organizations.
At present self-signup is not possible.

In the earlier `values.yaml` manifest, the following section was defined:

```yaml
platformAdministrators:
  subjects:
  - wile.e.coyote@acme.com
```

This forms an implicit mapping from a user to a special role that grants access to all-the-things.

In order to actually login, you will need a user account creating:

```yaml
kubectl unikorn create user \
     --namespace unikorn-identity \
     --user wile.e.coyote@acme.com
```

And at least one organization:

```yaml
kubectl unikorn create organization \
    --namespace unikorn-identity \
    --name looney-tunes
```

If your user's email address can be authenticated by any of the supported OIDC integrations, that's all you need to do, otherwise read on...

### 3rd Party Service Integration

When using an integration such as the [Kubernetes Service](https://github.com/unikorn-cloud/kubernetes) you will need to configure system account to RBAC mappings.
3rd party services usually act on behalf of a user, and as such need elevated global privileges, so as to avoid giving the end user permission to sensitive endpoints.

In the earlier `values.yaml` manifest, the following section was defined:

```yaml
systemAccounts:
  unikorn-kubernetes: infra-manager-service
  unikorn-compute: infra-manager-service
```

In very simple terms, when you create a 3rd party service, that will need to generate an X.509 certificate in order to authenticate with the tokens endpoint and issue an access token to talk to other service APIs.
That certificate will need to be signed by the trusted client CA (typically signed by the `unikorn-client-issuer` managed by cert-manager).
The X.509 Common Name (CN) encoded in the certificate is used to lookup a `SystemAccount` resource in any namespace.
The `SystemAccount` resource is then used to lookup a role defined in the same namespace that defines permissions.

The key benefit with this way of defining RBAC rules is that it can be done completely independently of the Identity service.
Care should, however, be taken to ensure only trusted actors are allowed to create roles and system accounts.

#### 3rd Party User RBAC

If you are defining your own resources then they will need roles to allow end users access to the those APIs.

The recommended way to do this is:

* Create any end-user roles in your 3rd party Helm deployment and ensure they are created in the same namespace as the Identity service.
  * These will automatically be picked up and exposed for consumption in organization groups.
* Create any platform-admin roles in your 3rd party Helm deployment as above...
  * Ensure the role is marked as protected to prevent it being exposed via the API, otherwise you may inadvertently end up allowing users to see into other organizations.
  * These can be granted to platform administrators via the `platformAdministrators.roles` list in the Identity Helm chart.

## What Next?

As you've noted, objects are named based on UUIDs, therefore administration is somewhat counter intuitive, but it does allow names to be mutable.
For ease of management we recommend installing the [UI](https://github.com/unikorn-cloud/ui)
